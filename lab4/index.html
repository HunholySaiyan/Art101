		<h1> Challange </h1>
				<p id="one"> We did not have any challanges, but we did struggle to come
					up with an ideal game that would be fun and challanging to play but
					would be easy to program as we did not want to make something really fun
					and find out that its too complicated and hard to program for beginners
					like us </P>
		<h1> Problems </h1>
			<p id="two"> The only problem we discovered was resolved by using W3Schools and we
				had trouble during the list as we did not know how to properly list the
				steps in a high level without missing any important steps
		<h1> Results </h1>
			<p> this is our everyday task we decided to make
				into a list, how to make homemade tortillas </p>
