        <h1> Lab 13: Loops</h1>

        <h1> Challenge </h1>
          <p> The challenge of this lab was to create a for loop that will print out 1 to 200 with different words based on <br> whether they match
            a certain value, for example numbers that are multiples of 3 will say the word Fizz.
           </p>

        <h1> Problems </h1>
          <p> I had a problem with task 2 part 8 becuase I did not undestand what it was asking, but one of project <br>partners helped me and I then figured it out
          </p>

        <h1> Results </h1>
          <p> The results should be in the bottom and should display the numbers with their key word </p>
        </div>
