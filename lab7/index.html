        <h1> Challage </h1>
          <p> I had one major challange in this lab and it was with the arrays I could not manage <br> to make them worked and after searching
        google I finally figured it out </p>
        <h1> problems </h1>
          <p> I had multiple problems with spelling within the arrays and strings, and that completly messed up my <br>
        code after a couple of minutes of looking at the console I figured it out and resolved it <br> after
        everything was working just as expected. </p>
